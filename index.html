    <p> Leads to Commitment
Sanger's commitment to birth control sprung from personal tragedy. One of eleven children born to a working class Irish Catholic family in Corning, New York, at age nineteen Margaret watched her mother die of tuberculosis. Just 50 years old, her mother had wasted away from the strain of eleven childbirths and seven miscarriages. Facing her father over her mother's coffin, Margaret lashed out, "You caused this. Mother is dead from having too many children."

<em>Nurses Botched Abortions</em>
Determined to <strong>escape</strong> her mother's fate, Sanger fled Corning to attend nursing school in the Catskills. Eventually, she found work in New York City as a visiting nurse on the Lower East Side. It was there that Sanger saw her personal tragedy writ large in the lives of poor, immigrant women. Lacking effective contraceptives, many women, when faced with another unwanted pregnancy, resorted to five-dollar back-alley abortions. It was after these botched abortions that Sanger was usually called in to care for the women. After experiencing many women's trauma and suffering, Sanger began to shift her attention from nursing to the need for better contraceptives.

Anger Turns to Action
Sanger began to <strong>devote</strong> more and more of her time to her mission. In 1914 she coined the term "<em>birth control</em>" and soon began to provide women with information and contraceptives. Indicted in 1915 for sending diaphragms through the mail and arrested in 1916 for opening the first birth control clinic in the country, Sanger would not be deterred. In 1921 she founded the American Birth Control League, the precursor to the Planned Parenthood Federation, and spent her next three decades campaigning to bring safe and effective birth control into the American mainstream.

    <p><span class="third">Margaret Hillert</span> (January 22, 1920 â€“ October 11, 2014) was an<span class="second"> American author</span>, poet and educator. Hillert, a lifelong resident of the <span class="pink-text">state of Michigan</span>, was known for her<span class="tenth", id="blue">children's literature</span>, having written over eighty books for beginning readers.[1] She began writing poetry at a young age and published her first verses in 1961.[2]

Hillert was born in Saginaw, Michigan, in 1920.[3][4] She was best known for her Dear Dragon series, which pairs tales of a young boy and his pet dragon with instructional notes, word lists, and activities to promote reading skills.[5] By using limited vocabulary and repeating words, her books are aimed at helping beginning readers gain skills and confidence.[3] Hillert's work has been illustrated by Ed Young, Nan Brooks, Kelly Oechsli, Kinuko Y. Craft, and Dick Martin.

Hillert received a nursing degree from the University of Michigan and a teaching degree from Wayne State University. She taught First Grade at Whittier Elementary in the Royal Oak Public School District for 34 years. She died on October 11, 2014, at the age of 94.[6]</p>
